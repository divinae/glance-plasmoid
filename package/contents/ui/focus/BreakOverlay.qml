// One fullscreen break overlay. Instantiated once per screen, because a single
// window only covers the display it is on, which left every other monitor
// uncovered during a break (gitlab #19).
//
// Plain fullscreen window. The variant that also keeps the overlay on every virtual
// desktop is BreakOverlayLayer.qml, which adds the layer-shell properties on top of
// this file - that module is optional and missing on some distributions, so importing
// it here would take the whole applet down with it (gitlab #58).
//
// Still a DashboardWindow rather than a plain Window: it enables blur behind
// itself in C++, and there is no QML binding for KWindowEffects to do that by
// hand. Replacing it with a plain Window cost the blur, which is very visible
// once the background is translucent. The layer-shell properties attach to it
// just as well.
//
// Takes the applet root rather than a dozen individual properties: it is an
// internal part of the applet, and the alternative was mirroring most of the
// root's state through this file.
