// One fullscreen break overlay. Instantiated once per screen, because a single
// window only covers the display it is on, which left every other monitor
// uncovered during a break (gitlab #19).
//
// Plain fullscreen window. The variant that also keeps the overlay on every virtual
// desktop is BreakOverlayLayer.qml, which adds the layer-shell properties on top of
// this file - that module is optional and missing on some distributions, so importing
// it here would take the whole applet down with it (gitlab #58).
//
// The unblurred flavour. Its layer-shell counterpart is BreakOverlayPlainLayer.qml;
// see BreakOverlay.qml for why the import lives there and not here (gitlab #58).
//
// DashboardWindow enables blur AND Plasma's background
// contrast effect in C++, and neither can be turned off from QML. Contrast takes
// its region from the window's alpha mask, so at a low background opacity the only
// alpha left is the buttons' own drop shadows - whose soft gradients it quantises
// into jagged halos. An ordinary Window asks the compositor for nothing, so the
// overlay is exactly what it draws.
//
// Takes the applet root rather than a dozen individual properties: it is an
// internal part of the applet, and the alternative was mirroring most of the
// root's state through this file.
