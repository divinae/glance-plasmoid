// One unblurred layer-shell overlay per screen, in a file of its own.
//
// This exists because a static type reference is an EAGER dependency: QML resolves every
// composite type named in a document when it loads that document, including inside a
// delegate, and including one whose Instantiator is inactive. So naming BreakOverlayPlainLayer
// in main.qml made main.qml itself fail wherever org.kde.layershell is missing - the very
// failure #58 reported, with the runtime probe never getting a chance to run.
//
// main.qml reaches this file through a Loader source URL instead, which is resolved at
// runtime, so a machine without the module never loads it and never sees the import.
